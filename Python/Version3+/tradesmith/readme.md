# Precise CSV Export from TradeSmith Portfolios

TradeSmith's built-in CSV export of user portfolio data cuts off precision, often leaving only a single significant digit. This can lead to inaccuracies when using the downloaded data for independent calculations. 

The full-precision of the data can be exported by accessing parts of the website not exposed to users.
